<h1>About</h1>
<div class="well">
    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>The organization is a union of students, enrolled at the University of Virginia, who closely cherish the desire as outlined by the purpose of the organization.
    
    This is a non-profit student organization. The organization cannot promote any particular political view, religious faith and racial discriminatory doctrine of any kind (All University of Virginia, state and federal nondiscriminatory policy applies).
    
    The organization will not engage in any activity against the interest of Bangladesh.
    
    Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency of the University. It is a separate and independent organization which is responsible for and manages its own activities and affairs. The University does not direct, supervise or control the organization and is not responsible for the organization’s contracts, acts or omissions.
    
    Our student organization does not restrict its membership, programs, or activities on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity, marital status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, veteran status, and family and genetic information. Notwithstanding these requirements, a CIO may petition to restrict its membership based on gender (e.g. all-male or all-female a cappella groups) or an ability to perform the activities related to the organization’s purpose by filing a written request with the Office of the Dean of Students. In evaluating any such requests, the University will look not merely to the constitution of an organization but to its actual practices and operations.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>This organization was formed in 2016 with the aim to unite all students and alumni of University of Virginia, and
    friends and families around the surrounding areas who belong to (either by citizenship or family heritage) or are interested in Bangladesh and share closeness to the cause of the birth of the great nation, Bangladesh and her prosperity. Utilizing this platofrm we would like to represent Bangladesh (History, Culture, Literature, Social values,
    Scholarly achievements, Concerns & Prospects) in all aspects in a formal way (as permitted by regulations for student organizations) at University of Virginia.
