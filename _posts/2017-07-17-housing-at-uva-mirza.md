Housing is one of the most commonly asked questions by incoming students. In general there are two option - 

* [On ground](https://housing.virginia.edu/graduate-students)
* [Off ground](https://offgroundshousing.student.virginia.edu/)

At UVA, campus is called `ground`.

> Before one decides on `on campus` vs. `off campus` housing, s/he is encouraged to read [this article](https://offgroundshousing.student.virginia.edu/files/resources/resource_3857.pdf).

### On ground housing

Considering all the facilities (i.e. transportation, and cost) `On ground housing` is the best option. Here is the list of On ground housing options according to the preference of current graduate students:

1. Copeley Hill Apartments
2. University Garden Apartments

Both of these options have 1 bedroom apartment, 2 bedroom apartment (shared, one washroom) and 3 bedroom apartment (shared, one washroom). 

There is another on ground housing option called Faulkner Drive Rooms (no review has been found yet).

Undergrad students are encouraged to look for their options [here](https://housing.virginia.edu/options).

> On ground housing is highly demanding. Submit application as early as possible.

> Housing application has to be submitted online
