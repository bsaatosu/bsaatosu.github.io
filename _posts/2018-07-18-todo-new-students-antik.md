1. The first thing one needs to do upon arrival on grounds (UVA campus is called “on ground”) is check in with the [ISO office](http://issp.virginia.edu/check-and-orientation). Make sure you have all the documents as mentioned in the website. You should be given a “green form” from the ISO office upon check-in.  If you aren’t, please ask for one. This form allows you to apply for a Social Security Number, a required item for working in the US.
2. At ISO, one may pick up the map of the university (hard copy), which is pretty handy for going to other places (mentioned below) initially.
3. Pick up the student ID ([ID Office link](http://www.virginia.edu/idoffice/)).
4. Check in with the graduate coordinator of your department. Bring all your paperwork (passport, I-20, etc) so that s/he can enter you into the payroll system.
5. Submitting health report (immunization documents) at Elson Student Health Center.
6. Opening a bank account – one can do that easily by going to Newcomb Hall and open a Bank of America account or other banks according to preference.
7. After one opens a bank account, update banking and residence info at UVA human resource self service website.
8. After staying for >10 days in USA (I94 takes time to be issued), a person will be eligible to apply for Social Security Number (for RA/TA). To do that, first check whether your I94 is issued or not (web link). With I94, I20, Passport and green form (from ISO office), one can apply for the SSN by going to US Social Security Administration at Charlottesville.
9. It takes at least 2 weeks to get the SSN by mail. Once one gets SSN, s/he should contact Logan Hobbs and sign a tax treaty (if applicable, your graduate coordinator should mention this to you or just ask him/her).
